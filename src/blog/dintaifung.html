                                <h2><strong>Din Tai Fung</strong></h2>
                                <p> Wow. I could not stop thinking about the best Hot and Sour Soup I've had--to the point where I have to make a food blog post about the restaurant. I have had the original Din Tai Fung in Taipei, but I have to argue that the one that
                                    they just opened in NYC is arguably better (though my friends may disagree). 
                                    <br><br>
                                    Going into the most exciting food experience I have had thus far in NYC, I knew that this place was either going to receive the best restaurant review on Beli or the most underwhelming one. So what is so exciting about this place? They 
                                    opened in July and have been releasing their reservations a whole month in advance which gets booked out quickly, showing just how much they have a fan base in NYC. This Taiwanese restaurant is known for their soup dumplings--maybe the best soup
                                    dumplings around!
                                    <br><br>
                                    As we entered the hottest restaurant in NYC, we realized that the restaurant is so much bigger than we initially thought. The restaurant is not only bigger than the one in Taipei, and it felt a lot more luxurious. Also, the restaurant in NYC requires reservations compared to the one in 
                                    Taipei, which only takes walk-ins. 
                                </p>

								<p>The next few days we watched movies, shopped, and walked around, soaking in Taipei's energy. The food in Taipei was phenomenal--life-changing.
                                    We left Taipei to travel to Jiufen to take a look at the Studio Ghibli-esque town that has plentiful red lanterns. I saw many cute cats in Jiufen, which is now a must-visit if I go back to Taiwan! 
                                </p>
                                <div class="container" style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; height: 50vh;">
                                    <img src ="../images/jiufen.jpeg" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; padding-bottom: 30px;" alt=""/>
                                </div>	
                                <p>We went to a tea house called Jiufen Teahouse, and the experience was amazing! We ate yummy desserts while we sipped on tea. We did not know which tea to order so we asked a tea master.
                                    The view was amazing! Our view was the sea, and since it was sunset. The whole sky turned a hue of coral colors while we took pictures and relaxed. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    We walked past a crowded area where tourists took pictures. The sunset was extremely beautiful, so our small group also stopped to take pictures!
                                </p>
                                
                                <div class="container" style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; height: 50vh;">
                                    <img src ="../images/jsunset.JPG" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; padding-bottom: 30px;" alt=""/>
                                </div>	
                                <p>
                                    After leaving Jiufen, we returned to Taipei. One of my friends departed a day earlier than me and our other friend, so we said 
                                    our goodbyes before heading out to enjoy our last day in the city. 
                                    My friend and I visited a teahouse, savoring one final relaxing break in Taipei. 
                                    Afterward, we explored the Ningxia Night Market. While the atmosphere was lively and the food tasty, we found the variety to be a bit limited, 
                                    which made the experience a bit underwhelming.
                                    <div class="container" style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; height: 50vh;">

                                    </div>
                                    <br><br>
                                    On my plane ride to the next destination, I feel a sense of contentment and fondness as I reflect on the fun moments spent in Taiwan with friends. I'm grateful for the wonderful company on this tripâ€”after all, 
                                    it's the friends who make the journey truly memorable!
