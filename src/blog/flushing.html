                                <h2><strong>Flushing</strong></h2>
                                <p> 
                                Located in very east part of Queens, Flushing has a diverse variety of Asian dishes. I think it is definitely the best neighborhood in Queens, but I am very biased. 
                                I thoroughly enjoy Asian food, so to the people who might not enjoy Asian food as much, this neighborhood might not be the one for you (and that is ok)!!! I will talk about all of my favorite restaurants and places to go to in Flushing, granted 
                                I have been to Flushing way too many times to count. 
                                <br><br>
                                I was raised in Westchester, NY, which is not too far from NYC. My parents love coming down to Flushing every weekend to buy Asian food and eat some of the best Asian food outside of Asia, so I would always tag along. Because of my continuous trips to Flushing with my family, 
                                I have developed an unique fonding towards Flushing that I have not developed for many other neighborhoods in NYC (but I will talk about other neighborhoods that I love in the future)!! These fond memories also translated to my love for food. I am always on a mission to find the next 
                                best restaurant. 

                                <br><br>
                                Flushing has some of the best cheap eats that are very delicious. I think sometimes people equate cost and quality, but just because something is expensive that does not mean that it is equivalently delicious. Unfortunately, I have learned that the hard way and spent way too much money on 
                                food that was not very delicious. On another note, Flushing has a great diverse set of Asian foods, especially Chinese foods. Whenever I go to Flushing, I tend to always stop at a hole in the wall restaurant for cheap eats. For example, take a look at the picture below!! I love the jianbing from Eight Jane. 
                                the flavorful youtiao stuffed inside the savory egg wrapping made a very delicious and filling breakfast. It tasted even better because I bought their homemade soymilk, which paired with the savory jianbing created a perfect combination.

								<p> Throughout college, I would always meet my family in Flushing to grab a meal. Whenever my grandmother came all the way from China to the USA, my parents would bring her to Flushing to treat her to a "homemade" style meal. Although she doesn't mention anything about her thoughts after eating the meal, I can see her 
                                    happy thoughts written all over her face. One of the most memorable meals we have shared thus far is definitely at Beijing Hot Pot, a Beijing style hot pot restaurant that serves fresh cuts of meat and vegetables. I love hot pot, but in my opinion, most of the hot pot stores in NYC are average, including Beijing Hot Pot. The reason 
                                    why Beijing Hot Pot stood out to me is because of the conversations my family shared over the tomato and saurkraut fish dual hot pot soup bases.

                                    In chinese culture, hot pot is meant to be shared with family. Because the hot pot's pot is circular and

                                <p>We went to a tea house called Jiufen Teahouse, and the experience was amazing! We ate yummy desserts while we sipped on tea. We did not know which tea to order so we asked a tea master.
                                    The view was amazing! Our view was the sea, and since it was sunset. The whole sky turned a hue of coral colors while we took pictures and relaxed. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    We walked past a crowded area where tourists took pictures. The sunset was extremely beautiful, so our small group also stopped to take pictures!
                                </p>
                                
                                <div class="container" style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; height: 50vh;">

                                <p>
                                    After leaving Jiufen, we returned to Taipei. One of my friends departed a day earlier than me and our other friend, so we said 
                                    our goodbyes before heading out to enjoy our last day in the city. 
                                    My friend and I visited a teahouse, savoring one final relaxing break in Taipei. 
                                    Afterward, we explored the Ningxia Night Market. While the atmosphere was lively and the food tasty, we found the variety to be a bit limited, 
                                    which made the experience a bit underwhelming.
                                    <div class="container" style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; height: 50vh;">

                                    <br><br>
                                    On my plane ride to the next destination, I feel a sense of contentment and fondness as I reflect on the fun moments spent in Taiwan with friends. I'm grateful for the wonderful company on this tripâ€”after all, 
                                    it's the friends who make the journey truly memorable!
