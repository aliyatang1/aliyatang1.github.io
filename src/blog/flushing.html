                                <h2><strong>Flushing</strong></h2>
                                <p> 
                                Located in eastern Queens, Flushing has a diverse variety of Asian dishes. I think it is definitely the best neighborhood in Queens, but I am very biased. 
                                I thoroughly enjoy Asian food, so to the people who might not enjoy Asian food as much, this neighborhood might not be the one for you (and that is ok)!!! I'll share some of my favorite restaurants and places to go to in Flushing, granted 
                                I have been to Flushing way too many times to count. 
                                <br><br>
                                I was raised in Westchester, NY, which is not too far from NYC. My parents love coming down to Flushing every weekend or so to buy Asian food and eat some of the best Asian food outside of Asia, so I would always tag along. Because of my continuous trips to Flushing with my family, 
                                I have developed an unique fonding towards Flushing that I have not felt for many other neighborhoods in NYC (but I will talk about other neighborhoods that I love in the future)! These fond memories also translated to my love for food. I am always on a mission to find the next 
                                best restaurant. 

                                <br><br>
                                Flushing has some of the best cheap eats that are very delicious. I think sometimes people equate cost and quality, but just because something is expensive that does not mean that it is equivalently delicious. Unfortunately, I have learned that the hard way and spent way too much money on 
                                food that was not very delicious. On another note, Flushing has a great diverse set of Asian foods, especially Chinese foods. Whenever I go to Flushing, I tend to always stop at a hole in the wall restaurant for cheap eats. For example, take a look at the picture below!! I love the jianbing from Eight Jane. 
                                the flavorful youtiao stuffed inside the savory egg wrapping made a very delicious and filling breakfast. It tasted even better because I bought their homemade soymilk, which paired with the savory jianbing created a perfect combination.

								<p> Throughout college, I would always meet my family in Flushing to grab a meal. Whenever my grandmother came all the way from China to the USA, my parents would bring her to Flushing to treat her to a "homemade" style meal. Although she doesn't mention anything about her thoughts after eating the meal, I can see her 
                                    happy thoughts written all over her face. One of the most memorable meals we have shared thus far is definitely at Beijing Hot Pot, a Beijing style hot pot restaurant that serves fresh cuts of meat and vegetables. I love hot pot, but in my opinion, most of the hot pot stores in NYC are average, including Beijing Hot Pot. The reason 
                                    why Beijing Hot Pot stood out to me is because of the conversations my family shared over the tomato and saurkraut fish dual hot pot soup bases. 
                                    <br><br>
									In Chinese culture, hot pot is a meal meant to be shared with family. The pot’s circular shape symbolizes unity and togetherness. At the center of the table, the boiling broth allows everyone to cook their own ingredients, creating a communal and interactive dining experience. I really like hot pot, even on warmer days where I want to drink ice cold water or enjoy 
									a bowl of shaved ice.

									I feel inclined to mention that my favorite hot pot is not Beijing Hot Pot, but instead it is Chongqing Lao Zao, coincidentally also located in Flushing. Sometimes I don't find myself agreeing with those "top ranked restaurant" lists, but in this instance, I 100% agree with all the lists that feature Chongqing Lao Zao. Honestly, I think it's better
									 than some of the hot pot restaurants in China. I attached an image of Chongqing Lao Zao right below this text. If you get the chance to go, PLEASE GOOOOO!!!! I really like their tomato and mala soup bases, even though I cannot eat spicy food. The decor inside the restaurant looks like older chinese decor and reminds me of the Chinese countryside. It's 
									 honestly one of the most beautifully--if not it IS the most beautifully--- decorated restaurant that I have ever been to. Ok, let me move on...

								<p>
									I added Jiang Nan and CheLi in there even though I'm a bit hesitant because I think some people might really enjoy their meals at those two restaurants and I think 
									there are some dishes that I would definitely go back for. I think it doesn't really suit my flavor palate because I like more of a 清淡 (light) meal.
