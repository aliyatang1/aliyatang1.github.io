                                <h2><strong>Hobbies That I Tried</strong></h2>
                                <p> I want to try hobbies that will give back to me. For instance, something like having tennis as a hobby is rewarding because you can make conversations with people about tennis and you can stay fit while having fun. I think hobbies are NOT overrated!
									It's so nice to have a hobby because it makes you feel like there is something in life that you truly is calming for you.
                                    <br><br>
                                    This semester I have been stressed, and I have resorted to what my generation calls "doom-scrolling" on my phone. I realized I spend way too much time on Tiktok whilst retaining none of the information I have watched. I spoke to my friend about this and he 
									mentioned how he read that scrolling on platforms such as Tiktok can be way more addicting than cigarettes because of the euphoric feeling of scrolling on the phone. I think the minute I heard those words come out of his mouth, it reaffirmed what I was thinking. I decided to delete Tiktok. 
									<br><br>
									I do have hobbies if you consider going out to eat with friends and working out as hobbies. I think both are hobbies because I enjoy doing both. I love going out to eat with my friends because it makes me feel great spending time and eating yummy foods with my friends. Rather than the food, I think it
									 is who you share a meal with! I love working out because it helps with stress relief, so whenever I feel very stressed, going to work out clears my head. I guess you can also consider blogging a hobby, although, I don't do it as much as I would like to. I want to have more hobbies!!!
                                    <br><br>
                                    I looked through Reddit and found cool subreddits with different people invested in their own hobbies. This is going to be the documentation of the different hobbies I decide to try and stick with! I want to try a new hobby every week.

								<p>The next few days we watched movies, shopped, and walked around, soaking in Taipei's energy. The food in Taipei was phenomenal--life-changing.
                                    We left Taipei to travel to Jiufen to take a look at the Studio Ghibli-esque town that has plentiful red lanterns. I saw many cute cats in Jiufen, which is now a must-visit if I go back to Taiwan! 
                                </p>

                                <p>We went to a tea house called Jiufen Teahouse, and the experience was amazing! We ate yummy desserts while we sipped on tea. We did not know which tea to order so we asked a tea master.
                                    The view was amazing! Our view was the sea, and since it was sunset. The whole sky turned a hue of coral colors while we took pictures and relaxed. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    We walked past a crowded area where tourists took pictures. The sunset was extremely beautiful, so our small group also stopped to take pictures!
                                </p>
                                
                                <div class="container" style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; height: 50vh;">
                                    <img src ="../images/jsunset.JPG" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; padding-bottom: 30px;" alt=""/>
                                </div>	
                                <p>
                                    After leaving Jiufen, we returned to Taipei. One of my friends departed a day earlier than me and our other friend, so we said 
                                    our goodbyes before heading out to enjoy our last day in the city. 
                                    My friend and I visited a teahouse, savoring one final relaxing break in Taipei. 
                                    Afterward, we explored the Ningxia Night Market. While the atmosphere was lively and the food tasty, we found the variety to be a bit limited, 
                                    which made the experience a bit underwhelming.
                                    <div class="container" style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; height: 50vh;">

                                    <br><br>
                                    On my plane ride to the next destination, I feel a sense of contentment and fondness as I reflect on the fun moments spent in Taiwan with friends. I'm grateful for the wonderful company on this tripâ€”after all, 
                                    it's the friends who make the journey truly memorable!
