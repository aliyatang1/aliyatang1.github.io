                                <h2><strong>Reminiscing Taiwan</strong></h2>
                                <p> After an over 12 hour layover in Seoul, South Korea, my friend and I finally landed in Taipei. We met up with another friend 
                                    who took an earlier flight. We planned the trip on good old trusty spreadsheets, waiting for our group trip to finally take place. Being excited was an 
                                    understatement. I could not sleep the first few nights there because I was so excited to go on our daily adventures. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    From the way people carry themselves to the way the tea tastes, Taipei was so different from New York City. We toured Taipei 101, climbing to the top-most floor to get an aerial view of Taipei. 
                                    There was a very cool map at the top floor that showed distant places in Taiwan and the corresponding views from Taipei 101. The best part about Taipei 101 were the very cool water bottles! They had Taipei 101
                                    shaped plastic water bottles. 
                                </p>
                                <div class="container" style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; height: 50vh;">

                            </div>						
								<p>The next few days we watched movies, shopped, and walked around, soaking in Taipei's energy. The food in Taipei was phenomenal--life-changing.
                                    We left Taipei to travel to Jiufen to take a look at the Studio Ghibli-esque town that has plentiful red lanterns. I saw many cute cats in Jiufen, which is now a must-visit if I go back to Taiwan! 
                                </p>
                                <div class="container" style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; height: 50vh;">

                                </div>	
                                <p>We went to a tea house called Jiufen Teahouse, and the experience was amazing! We ate yummy desserts while we sipped on tea. We did not know which tea to order so we asked a tea master.
                                    The view was amazing! Our view was the sea, and since it was sunset. The whole sky turned a hue of coral colors while we took pictures and relaxed. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    We walked past a crowded area where tourists took pictures. The sunset was extremely beautiful, so our small group also stopped to take pictures!
                                </p>
